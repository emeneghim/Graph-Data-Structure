# Data-Structures (Graphs)

This project represents some code written in C# that was developed to the discipline of Data Structures 2 to my college, and it was Developed in Portuguese

That project contains the code to the following Data Structures: Undirected and Directed Graphs (as well as basic commands of those two structures), search algorithms such as DFS (Depth First Search) and BFS (Breadth First Search) and it also has some specific algorithms around that Data Structure, like Dijkstra and Kruskal.
